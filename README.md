Hello!

Welcome to my gif search engine made with html, css, javascript, jQuery, ajax, and the Giphy API.

Help Wall-E look at GIFs of his friends by using the search bar to look up some of his pixar friends. You can add your own button to add to the others so you can have quick access to them.


This was done for Case Western's full stack coding bootcamp.
